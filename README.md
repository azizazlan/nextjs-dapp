    2. Chain ID = 31337l
5. In Metamask, import account. Use the private key string of the first account (index 0). (Select this imported account, as it will be the owner of the smart contract)
6. Set the `PRIVATE_KEY` in the .env file (create .env file under the project directory).

    ```
    PRIVATE_KEY=0123...
    ```

7. In a new terminal, deploy the smart contract `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost`. Take note of the smart contract address.
8. Configure `PRIVATE_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDR` in a new .env file (Create this .env file in the `client` directory. Yes there are two .env files).

    PRIVATE_KEY=0123...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDR=0x5f...
    ```
9. Top start the frontend app, open a new terminal, change into the `client` directory, and run:
